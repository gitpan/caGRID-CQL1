ABOUT

caGrid is a service-oriented platform that supports cutting-edge 
collaborative e-Science by providing the tools for organizations to 
integrate data silos, securely share data and compose analysis 
pipelines. caGrid supports e-Science initiatives in basic, 
translational, and clinical research. The focus of caGRID at the 
moment is primarily cancer research, and publicly available data 
offered by caGRID currently is concerned with proteins and genes and 
experiments on proteins and genes as they relate to cancer.

The modules in this package are dedicated to constructing, validating, 
and sending CQL queries to caGRID, as CQL is the structured XML query 
language used in caGRID.
